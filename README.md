# Fund-Split Repository
## Overview
Development of application to help manage group finances during events of any sort. By inputting who paid for what during an event, the application will provide how much each person is owed by the others and owes to the others.
A big part of this is that I personally want to use this because I am tired of doing spreadsheets after group activities.

## Purpose
This is something that could be created through Excel only. The goal is to develop an application by myself to explore the softeare engineering process by following the guidelines of the ECSE 321 McGill Software Engineering course.
